Redux:


Redux is a js library used for application state management.

The main purpose of React is to display the UI content in a lightning speed, But React is also taking 
care of data management,due to which the user experience could be affected. To Segregate the data layer from 
presentation layer we can use redux. 


React - presentation Layer - Displaying the data on the UI.

Redux - Data Layer - Managing the application data (state).


Redux Workflow:

Store : It maintains the global state of the application.

Root Reducer : Responsible to gather all the reducers and put them under one object and send it to 
Store.

In Other words, Root reducer builds the application state

Reducer : is used filter / maintain the data of a specific functionality and pass it on to Root Reducer

Action : generates the data by making API Calls.

Container: It is the react componant that interacts with redux

Container ->  Action -> Reducer -> Root Reducer -> Store
